## Install
Once you install the Angular CLI, NODE, and Yarn, you can then run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies.  this will take a wee bit of time.  You can also try `yarn install`, but it is not wise to have a lock file for NPM and YARN.  However, I gave you both for you to choose. 

## Building
Run `ng build` to build the app. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
